After a long streak of procrastination, I have finally deployed my Weblog on Pelican_ which is a static site generator written in Python. I can now write my posts from the terminal using vim! These posts are written using reStructuredText_, part of Python's Docutils. I've also created a GitHub repo for this blog. 

There is also an option of importing content from my old blog on Wordpress which I will procrastinate further.
