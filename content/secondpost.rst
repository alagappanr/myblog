Starting in September last year, I started running regularly in order to improve my fitness and stamina. What started off as running on a treadmill at the gym_, gradually shifted to road running. I have been regularly practising and participating in running events happening in and around Chennai.

In the last few months, I have completed the following events:

    - **CTC's Buckingham Canal Marathon 2012** Ran 5K in an approx time of 25-30mins. 

    - **The Wipro Chennai Marathon 2012** Ran the Half Marathon Distance 21.1km in 2:12:29, my personal best.

    - **Auroville Marathon 2013** Again the half marathon distance albeit a bit slower. 2:19:20
      
Marathons are gradually becoming popular in India as more and more people start running for fitness and health. There are quite a few running events to look forward to now. Next in line is the Dream Runners Half Marathon happening at Chennai on the 7th of July, 2013. 

The Chennai Trekking Club (CTC) is also actively promoting Triathlons which is Swimming + Cycling + Running. I have registered for one of them which is scheduled sometime in the last week of Jule.  Now it is time to go for some advanced swimming classes to improve my strokes and speed. :)
